# Create charts with Index AI

The Index AI chart builder lets you explore and analyze metrics by simply asking what kind of data you're looking for. Index AI will generate a relevant chart based on your metrics catalog, which can then be explored, shared or saved to a report.

> **Beta feature**  
> The AI chart builder is currently in beta. Workspace admins can request access for their workspace by contacting support.


## Overview

Index AI empowers you to create dynamic charts with:

- Full metric flexibility
- Multiple visualization options including rank, line, and bar charts
- Smart temporal analysis with customizable periods and granularity
- Comparative analysis capabilities across metrics, timeframes, and targets
- In-depth dimensional breakdowns

## Getting Started

The Index AI experience begins with a simple click on the AI icon in the bottom-right corner of any Index screen. Here's how to make the most of it:

- Start with your query - whether specific ("Display quarterly revenue as a rank chart by region") or general ("Revenue Asia"), Index AI intelligently determines the most suitable visualization.

- Once your chart appears, you have options to explore further, share with colleagues, or add it to your reports.

- Take advantage of the contextual awareness - refine your charts through natural conversation and drill down deeper into your data.

- Need a fresh start? Access the menu via the three dots (â€¦) in the top-right corner and select 'Clear history'.

## Common Questions

**Is the data reliable?**

Your charts draw directly from your metric catalog definitions, ensuring accuracy. While Index AI strives to provide relevant visualizations, as a beta feature, it may occasionally misinterpret queries. We recommend validating insights before making critical decisions.

**What information can Index AI access?**

Index AI operates solely with metadata from the semantic layer, including metric names, descriptions, and dimension details. Your data warehouse information remains completely protected - Index AI only processes metadata to create relevant visualizations[1].

**Which AI technology powers the system?**

Index AI's chart builder runs on GPT-4o from OpenAI.

**Are my conversations used for AI training?**

No, your interactions with Index AI remain private and are not used for model training[1].

**How can I disable Index AI?**

To remove Index AI from your workspace or opt out of the beta, simply reach out to our support team.
