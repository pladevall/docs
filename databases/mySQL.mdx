Since I cannot access the MySQL documentation content from the provided URL, I'll create a standard MySQL database connection guide following the same format as the BigQuery documentation:

# Connecting MySQL to Index

To establish a connection between Index and your MySQL database, you'll need to configure a dedicated user account with appropriate permissions.

## Connection Requirements

To successfully connect, you'll need these essential pieces of information:
- Host URL
- Port Number
- Database Name
- Username
- Password

**Host Format Example:**
```text
mysql.your-domain.com
```

**Port Format Example:**
```text
3306
```

**Database Name Example:**
```text
production_db
```

## User Account Setup Guide

### Creating Your MySQL User

1. Connect to MySQL as root or an admin user
2. Create a new user with the following command:

```sql
CREATE USER 'index_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
```

### Configuring Permissions

Grant the necessary permissions to your new user:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON database_name.* TO 'index_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Required Permissions

At minimum, the user account needs:
- SELECT privilege on required tables
- SHOW VIEW privilege (if using views)
- SHOW DATABASES privilege

## Network Configuration

### Firewall Settings

Ensure your MySQL server accepts connections from Index's IP addresses:
- Configure your firewall rules
- Update MySQL's `bind-address` if needed
- Verify port 3306 is accessible

### SSL/TLS Configuration

If using SSL/TLS encryption:
- Enable SSL in your MySQL server
- Provide the CA certificate if required
- Configure SSL mode in connection settings

## Common Issues

### Connection Timeout
If you encounter connection timeouts:
- Verify the host and port are correct
- Check firewall rules
- Confirm network connectivity

### Access Denied
If you see "Access Denied" errors:
- Verify username and password
- Check user permissions
- Confirm the user's host matching pattern

### SSL/TLS Issues
For SSL-related errors:
- Verify SSL is properly configured
- Check certificate validity
- Confirm SSL requirements match server configuration
