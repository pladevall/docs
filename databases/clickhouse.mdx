# Connecting ClickHouse to Index

To establish a connection between Index and your ClickHouse database, you'll need to configure proper authentication credentials and access permissions.

## Connection Requirements

To successfully connect, you'll need these essential pieces of information:
- Host URL
- Port Number
- Database Name
- Username
- Password
- SSL Settings (optional)

**Host Format Example:**
```text
clickhouse.your-domain.com
```

**Port Format Example:**
```text
8443
```

**Database Example:**
```text
production_db
```

## User Setup Guide

### Creating Your ClickHouse User

1. Connect to ClickHouse using a client with admin privileges
2. Create a dedicated user for Index:

```sql
CREATE USER index_user IDENTIFIED WITH plaintext_password BY 'your_secure_password';
```

### Configuring Permissions

Grant necessary permissions to the Index user:

```sql
-- Grant database access
GRANT SELECT ON production_db.* TO index_user;

-- Grant show tables permission
GRANT SHOW TABLES ON production_db.* TO index_user;

-- Grant describe permission
GRANT DESCRIBE ON production_db.* TO index_user;
```

## Required Permissions

The Index user needs these minimum privileges:
- SELECT on required tables
- SHOW TABLES
- DESCRIBE
- SHOW DATABASES (if accessing multiple databases)

## Connection Methods

### HTTP Interface

For HTTP connections:
- Default port: 8443 (SSL) or 8123 (non-SSL)
- Supports basic authentication
- Recommended for most setups

### Native Interface

For native protocol:
- Default port: 9440 (SSL) or 9000 (non-SSL)
- Higher performance

## SSL Configuration

### Enabling SSL

If using SSL connections:
1. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured
2. Use the appropriate secure port
3. Provide SSL certificates if using self-signed certs

## Common Issues

### Connection Failed
