## Connecting to Your Snowflake Database

To establish a connection between Index and your Snowflake database, you'll need a Snowflake user account with appropriate permissions. Enter these credentials in Index:

- Account Identifier
- Database
- User
- Password

## Creating a Dedicated Snowflake User

For optimal security and management, we recommend creating a specific user and role for Index. Here's how to set it up:

## Step-by-Step Configuration

**1. Create a New Worksheet**
Navigate to your Snowflake console's Worksheets section and create a fresh worksheet.

**2. Set Up Role and User**
Execute the following SQL script, replacing the bracketed placeholders with your specific details:

```sql
-- Create Role
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS INDEX;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE <COMPUTE_WH> TO ROLE INDEX;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <MY_DATABASE> TO ROLE INDEX;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <MY_SCHEMA> TO ROLE INDEX;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <MY_SCHEMA> TO ROLE INDEX;

-- Create User
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS index PASSWORD = '<unique-password>' MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE;
GRANT ROLE INDEX TO USER index;
ALTER USER index SET DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = <COMPUTE_WH>;
```

**3. Configure Index Connection**
Input the user credentials in the Index database configuration form and verify the connection.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**No Active Warehouse Error**
If you encounter: "No active warehouse selected in current session. Select an active warehouse using the 'use warehouse' command."
- Verify that the user has a default warehouse configured
- Confirm the role has proper warehouse usage permissions

**Database Access Error**
If you see: "Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name."
- Double-check the database name in your configuration
- Ensure the user has DEFAULT_ROLE set
- Verify all required permissions are granted for the database and schema
