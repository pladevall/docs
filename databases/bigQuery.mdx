# Connecting BigQuery to Index

To establish a connection between Index and your BigQuery database, you'll need to configure a service account in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with appropriate data access permissions.

### Connection Requirements

To successfully connect, you'll need three essential pieces of information:

* Project ID
* Service Account Email
* Private Key


## Connection Requirements

To successfully connect, you'll need three essential pieces of information:

- Project ID
- Service Account Email
- Private Key

**Project ID Format Example:**

```
project-name-123456

```

**Service Account Email Format Example:**

```
serviceaccount@project-name-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com

```

**Private Key Format Example:**

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n
MIIEvgIBADANBgkq...F6HhhtvY\\n
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n

```

## Service Account Setup Guide

### Creating Your Service Account

1. Visit the GCP Console's IAM & Admin > Service Account section
2. Click "Create Account"

### Configuring Permissions

Assign these two roles to your service account:

- BigQuery Data Viewer
- BigQuery Job User

### Generating Authentication Credentials

1. Locate your service account in the overview
2. Open the Actions menu
3. Select "Manage keys"
4. Click "Add key" â†’ "Create new key"
5. Choose JSON as your key type
6. Download the generated JSON file

### Connecting to Index

Open your downloaded JSON file and locate these fields:

- `project_id`
- `client_email`
- `private_key`

Enter these values in the corresponding fields in Index's database connection form.

## Sample JSON Configuration

INSERT HERE
```
To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
```
## Required Permissions

For custom role configuration, ensure these permissions are included:

- `bigquery.datasets.get`
- `bigquery.jobs.create`
- `bigquery.tables.get`
- `bigquery.tables.getData`
- `bigquery.tables.list`

## Common Issues

### Decoder Error

If you encounter `error:1E08010C:DECODER routines::unsupported`, verify your private key format matches:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nMII...tvY\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n

```

### Invalid JWT Signature

If you see `invalid_grant: Invalid JWT Signature`, your private key may be invalid. Generate a new one through your service account settings.
