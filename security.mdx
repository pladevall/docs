At Index, safeguarding your data is our top priority. We implement robust security measures to ensure your information remains protected at all times.

## Credentials Encryption

All user credentials are encrypted at rest using advanced encryption standards. This means that when your credentials are stored on our servers, they are transformed into a secure format that unauthorized parties cannot easily decipher. Google Cloud employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encrypting data at rest, with AES-256 being the default encryption method.

## Data Caching

To enhance your user experience, we cache data within our Google Cloud Platform instance for a duration of 6 hours. This caching mechanism allows for quicker data retrieval and improved performance. It's important to note that data cached in Cloud Storage is encrypted at the storage level using Data Encryption Keys (DEKs), which utilize AES-256 by default.

## Commitment to Security

We continuously monitor and update our security practices to align with industry standards and best practices (beyond what's required for our SOC-II certification). Our team is dedicated to ensuring that your data remains confidential, integral, and available whenever you need it.

For any questions or concerns about our security measures, please contact our support team ([support@index.app](mailto:support@index.app)).
